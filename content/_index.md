# Chain Reaction DIY Bike Workshop üõ†Ô∏èüö≤‚öôÔ∏è

Welcome to _your_ bike workshop. We are a non-profit, self-organized and volunteer-driven workshop.
<br>

Our aim is to liberate each other from the vicious consumer cycle via mutual aid. Most industrially-produced goods are made to break, we want to focus on repair & reuse rather than replacement. 
<br>

## How does it work

You can use any of our tools and do whatever you need to do with your bike.

If you are not sure how to repair it, we can guide you through it.

If you need to replace a part, we might have some that we scanvanged or were donated. No guarantee though!
