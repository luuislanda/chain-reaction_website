# Chain Reaction Community Bike Workshop Website 

This website was built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and a modified version of the [Anemone](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone) theme that prioritizes clean CSS and avoids JavaScript as much as possible.

It focuses on simplicity, designed for single pagers or websites that don't require much updating. It also avoid any form of tracking or fingerprinting scripts. Hence why a cookie banner is not required.

## Help us

We are working on the website so that it is compliant with the international guidelines for accesible web content. The web team is not too experienced with this so any help is amazing!

### Disclaimer
This repository is for the Chain Reaction Website. To modify it's contents you will need to at least familiar with markdown based static site generators such as Zola. 

As this page is a one-pager, all of the content is in the /content/_index.md

If you intend to also use Cryptpad in your website, note that the iframe will not render unless it is called from an https address. At the time of writing Zola does not support locally deployed TLS. This can make local testing tricky, but not impossible. I recommend to directly test it in your server or maybe Zola will add support for it soon.
